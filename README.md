NumGuesser 🎯

NumGuesser is a fun and interactive number guessing game built with plain JavaScript. 

The game generates a random secret number, and the player's task is to guess the correct number while getting helpful hints along the way. 

This project is a great introduction to JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and simple game logic.
